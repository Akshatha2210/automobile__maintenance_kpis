## Overview
This project analyzes IoT sensor and maintenance data from connected vehicles (inspired by brands like Mercedes-Benz) to derive predictive insights using SQL. It demonstrates how SQL can be used to assess vehicle health, breakdown trends, and service intervals.

## 🗃️ Dataset Structure

### 1. `vehicle_info`
Basic info about each vehicle.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| vehicle_id | Unique ID |
| model | Car model |
| year | Manufacturing year |
| engine_type | Fuel type |
| mileage_km | Total distance driven |

### 2. `sensor_readings`
Telemetry data collected daily.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| oil_temp | °C |
| engine_temp | °C |
| brake_wear | % worn |
| battery_voltage | Volts |

### 3. `alerts`
Warnings generated by onboard diagnostics.

### 4. `maintenance_logs`
Historical service records.

### 5. `breakdowns`
Critical breakdown events.

## 🔍 Key Insights via SQL

- Avg. time between services using `LEAD()`
- High-severity unresolved alerts
- Vehicles overdue for maintenance
- Sensor trends before breakdowns
- Component failure analysis

---

## 💡 Example Queries

- Days between services (per vehicle)
- Breakdown patterns by component
- Vehicles with >2 alerts in past 7 days
- Average engine & brake wear over time
